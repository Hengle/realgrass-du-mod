## Credits and history
Real Grass was originally created by Uncanny_Valley in 2015, as an automatic [vanilla-friendly grass](http://forums.dfworkshop.net/download/file.php?id=6) placer for Daggerfall Unity. It supported two kinds of grass for different climates.

In 2016, and more in 2017, TheLacus expanded it, adding [water plants](https://i.imgur.com/xoAoh61.png) and [rocks](https://i.imgur.com/pGyA0xQ.png) for different climates, and moving it as an indipendent mod allowing settings and customization from users.

At the same time, while it was still hosted alongside the Daggerfall Unity project, it received [contributions](https://twitter.com/zottgrammes/status/810390248647696384) from Midopa.
